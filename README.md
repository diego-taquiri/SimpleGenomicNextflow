# SimpleGenomicNextFlow

Hi, here are some simple scripts on Nextflow for genomics and metagenomics in general. I wrote these scripts because sometimes NF-core pipelines are over-engineered and hard to modify. So if you want some very simple and flexible pipelines, you can just use these. For anyone who might find them useful.
